## What is AvalonShell?
- Avalon Shell is a Hybrid-Shell(Unix-simplifed + Windows + Custom CMDS) and there are 5 features that makes AvalonShell powerful:

- 1: Multi-path support: `AvalonShell` uses slots to store paths and you can use the built-in `slot` cmd to switch slot from 1 to 10 and you can also create unlimited custom slots with `newslot`, switch custom slot with `cslot` and switch directory or updating that slot with `scd`
- 2: Shell linking: You can use `slink` to execute cmds+args to other shells like `cmd prompt` on **Windows** and `gnome-terminal` on Linux\MacOS
- 3: Paste from clipboard: AvalonShell have a built-in `paste` cmd that will paste from your clipboard
- 4: Run file: AvalonShell have 2 built-in run cmds: `runfile` & `runsel`. `runfile` will run a file that **contains** `AvalonShell's instruction` and `runsel` will open a file dialog to choose a file that have AvalonShell's instructions and run it, just like runfile but improved in QOL
- 5: Admin Privileges: AvalonShell have a function that relaunch AvalonShell with Admin Privileges named `admin`

- 6: Decent for Systematic Devs: have symbols like: || && & ;
